# project-plan
Generic thoughts on project development

- Log all user specific activities (without sensitive data) for future reports, charts, analytics
- Use Bus (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)
- Store data for each tenant (company) in separate stores
- Build pieces as microservices
- Don't split into microservices too early
- Write e2e tests, integrational, test services independently
